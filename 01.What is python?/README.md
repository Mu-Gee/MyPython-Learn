# Python huh! So what is it?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

## Some facts about python

Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.

Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.

Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.

Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.

The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:

Machine Learning
GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
Test frameworks
Multimedia
Scientific computing
Text processing and many more...

Don't be scared with all this big & fancy words, everything will be okay(with a sprinkle of sarcasm)
